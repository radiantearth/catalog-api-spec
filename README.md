## About

The SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification aims to standardize the way geospatial assets are exposed online and queried. 
A 'spatiotemporal asset' is any file that represents information about the earth captured in a certain space and 
time. The initial focus is primarily remotely-sensed imagery (from satellites, but also planes, drones, balloons, etc), but 
the core is designed to be extensible to SAR, full motion video, point clouds, hyperspectral, LiDAR and derived data like
NDVI, Digital Elevation Models, mosaics, etc. 

The goal is for all major providers of imagery and other earth observation data to expose their data as SpatioTemporal Asset 
Catalogs, so that new code doesn't need to be written whenever a new JSON-based REST API comes out that makes its data 
available in a slightly different way. This will enable standard library components in many languages. STAC can also be
implemented in a completely 'static' manner, enabling data publishers to expose their data by simply publishing linked JSON
files online.

## WARNING

The specification is currently still an early version, with the potential for some major things to change. The core is now
fleshed out, so implementors are encouraged to try it out and give feedback. But the goal is to actually be able to act
on that feedback, which will mean changes are quite possible. 

But efforts will be made to maintain the core fields established in the central [Item spec](item-spec/) and 
[Catalog spec](catalog-spec). The minimal amount is specified right now, but best practices should emerge with 
implementation and more will likely be specified.

## Current version and branches

The master branch is the 'stable' version of the spec. It is currently version 
[0.5.2](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/milestone/8) of the specification. The 
[dev](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/tree/dev) branch, which you are looking at right now, is where active development takes place, and may have inconsistent examples. 
Whenever dev stabilizes a release is cut and we merge dev in to master. So master should be stable at any given time.
It is possible that there may be small releases in quick succession, especially if they are nice improvements that do 
not require lots of updating. 

## Communication

For any questions feel free to jump on our [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/SpatioTemporal-Asset-Catalog/Lobby) or email 
our [google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/stac-spec). The majority of communication about the evolution of 
the specification takes place in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/issues) and in 
[pull requests](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pulls)

## In this Repository

This repository contains the core specifications plus examples and validation schemas and tools. Also included are a
few documents that provide more context and plans for the evolution of the specification. Each spec folder contains a
README explaining the layout of the folder, the main specification document, examples, validating schemas and OpenAPI
documents (if relevant). The four specifications detailed are meant to be used together, but are designed so each piece
is small, self-contained and reusable in other contexts.

**[item-spec/](item-spec/)** defines a SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog `Item`, which is a [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org) Feature
with additional fields for things like time, links to related entities and assets (including thumbnails). This is the 
atomic unit that describes the data to be discovered.

**[catalog-spec/](catalog-spec/)** specifies a structure to link various `Items` together to be crawled or browsed. It is a
simple, flexible JSON file of links to `Item`s or other `Catalogs` that can be used in a variety of ways.

**[dataset-spec/](dataset-spec/)** provides additional information about a set of `Item`s that are made available by a 
data provider. It includes things like the spatial and temporal extent of the set of data, the license, keywords, etc. It 
enables discovery at a higher level than individual items, providing a simple way to describe sets of data.

**[api-spec/](api-spec/)** extends the core publishing capabilities of STAC with an active REST search endpoint that returns
just the `Item`s a user requests in their query. It is specified as a couple [OpenAPI](http://openapis.org) documents, one
[standalone](api-spec/STAC-standalone.yaml) and one that is [integrated with WFS3](api-spec/WFS3core%2BSTAC.yaml) 
(see [wfs github](https://github.com/opengeospatial/wfs_fes) for info on it). The documents also include the `/stac/` 
endpoint which is a way for a dynamic server to provide catalog and dataset browsing.

**Extensions:** The *[extensions/](extensions/)* folder is where extensions (profiles) live. Extensions can extend the 
functionality of the core spec or add fields for specific domains like Earth Observation.

**Additional documents** include the current [roadmap](roadmap.md) and a complementary [how to help](how-to-help.md)
document, a [list of implementations](implementations.md), 
and a discussion of the collaboration [principles](principles.md) and specification approach.

## Design Overview

An important core principle of the STAC design is to embrace best practices of making data available on the web (like 
[HATEOAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS) and [W3C Spatial Data on the Web](https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/)), and 
to leverage the reliability of flat files on object stores like [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/). This leads to putting the 'static catalog' at the core of the STAC spec.

#### Static Catalog

A static catalog is an implementation of the STAC specification that does not respond dynamically to requests - it is simply
a set of files on a web server that link to one another in a way that can be crawled. A static catalog can only really be
crawled by search engines and active catalogs; it can not respond to queries. But it is incredibly reliable, as there are
no moving parts, no clusters or databases to maintain. The goal of STAC is to expose as much asset metadata online as 
possible, so the static catalog offers a very lower barrier to entry for anyone with geospatial assets to make their data 
searchable.

#### Catalog API

A catalog API is a RESTful API that responds to queries (like give me all imagery in Oahu gathered on January 15, 2017). 
But its structure and responses are designed to mirror the static catalog, so the same client and crawler tools can consume
it. It generally indexes data for efficient responses, and aims to be easy for existing API's to implement as a more standard
interface for clients to consume. It is specified in OpenAPI 3.0. An active catalog will often be populated by a static catalog,
or at least may have a 'backup' of its fields stored as a cached static catalog.

#### Core Metadata and Extensions

The [SpatioTemporal Asset Metadata](https://github.com/radiantearth/stam-spec) specification defines the core fields that all 
assets must make available for searching in a catalog. Vendors can extend those core fields for the metadata they want to 
make available, and the community is starting to define shared extensions, with 'earth observation' (satellite imagery) being 
the first one. This repo contains the [STAC Item](item-spec/item-spec.md) definition, which is the primary json extension of STAM, 
so it can evolve with the rest of the STAC spec more easily. The STAM repo retains the abstract definition, and may evolve 
to contain other extensions.
