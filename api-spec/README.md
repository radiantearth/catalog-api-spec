# Catalog API Specification

This folder specifies the dynamic version of SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog - the Catalog API. For now the complete
definition is contained in the [spec.yaml](spec.yaml) file, which is an [OpenAPI](http://openapis.org) 2.0 (swagger)
yaml document. In time more narrative will be added describing the decisions and recommendations on implementing
the STAC API.

The easiest way to explore the specification in a more human readable way is to load the file up in to the 
[online swagger editor](http://editor.swagger.io). You can import the spec by just selectiong 'file' -> 
'import url' and enter <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/dev/api-spec/spec.yaml>. 

This will display the documentation and examples for the specification. You can also generate code for
clients and servers in a variety of languages from the editor as well, so you can get a sense of how it 
will work.
