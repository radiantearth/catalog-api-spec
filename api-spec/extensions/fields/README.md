# Fields API Extension

**Extension [Maturity Classification](../../../extensions/README.md#extension-maturity): Pilot**

By default, the STAC search endpoint `/stac/search` returns all attributes of each Item, as there is no way to specify exactly those attributes that should be returned. The Fields API extension adds a new option that allows the user to explicitly define which fields in an Item should be included or excluded in the response. 

When calling `/stac/search` using POST with`Content-Type: application/json`, this extension adds an attribute `fields` with an object value to the core JSON search request body. The `fields` object contains two attributes with string array values, `include` and `exclude`.

When calling `/stac/search` using GET or POST with `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `Content-Type: multipart/form-data`, the semantics are the same, except the syntax is a single parameter `fields` with a comma-separated list of attribute names, where `exclude` values are those prefixed by a `-` and `include` values are those with no prefix, e.g., `-geometry`, or `id,properties,-properties.proj:geometry`.

It is recommended that implementations meet the `include` and `exclude` sets specified by the request, but this is not required. Implementations are still considered compliant if fields not specified as part of `include` are in the response or ones specified as part of `exclude` are.  Implementations may choose to always include simple string fields like `id` and `type` regardless of the `exclude` specification. However, it is recommended that implementations honor excludes for attributes with more complex and arbitrarily large values (e.g., `geometry`, `assets`).  For example, some Items may have a geometry with a simple 5 point polygon, but these polygons can be very large when reprojected to EPSG:4326, as in the case of a highly-decimated sinusoidal polygons.

No error should be returned if a specified field has no value for it in the catalog.  For example, if the attribute "properties.eo:cloud_cover" is specified but there is no cloud cover value for an Item or the API does not even support the EO Extension, a successful HTTP response should be returned and the Item entities will not contain that attribute. 

Note that excluding attributes may allow for returning an invalid GeoJSON Feature or STAC Item. For example, if `type` and `geometry` are excluded, the entity will not be a valid GeoJSON Feature, or if `bbox` is excluded then the entity will not be a valid STAC Item.

Implementations may return attributes not specified, e.g., id, but should avoid anything other than a minimal entity representation. 


## Include/Exclude Semantics 

1. If `fields` attribute is specified with an empty object, or with both `include` and `exclude` set to null or an empty array, the behavior is as if `include` was set to `["id", "type", "geometry", "bbox", "links", "assets", "properties.datetime"]`.  This default is so that the entity returned is a valid STAC Item.  Implementations may choose to add other properties, e.g., `created`, but the number of default properties attributes should be kept to a minimum.
2. If only `include` is specified, these attributes are added to the default set of attributes (set union operation). 
3. If only `exclude` is specified, these attributes are subtracted from the union of the default set of attributes and the `include` attributes (set difference operation).  This will result in an entity that is not a valid Item if any of the excluded attributes are in the default set of attributes.
4. If both `include` and `exclude` attributes are specified, semantics are that a field must be included and **not** excluded.  E.g., if `properties` is included and `properties.datetime` is excluded, then `datetime` should not appear in the attributes of `properties`.

## Examples

Return baseline fields.  This **must** return valid STAC Item entities. 

```json
{
  "fields": {
  }
}
```

This has a similar effect as an empty object for `fields`, but it is up to the discretion of the implementation 

```json
{
  "fields": {
    "include": [
      "id",
      "type",
      "geometry",
      "bbox",
      "properties",
      "links",
      "assets"
    ]
  }
}
```

Exclude `geometry` from the baseline fields.  This **must** return an entity that is not a valid GeoJSON Feature or a valid STAC Item.

```json
{
  "fields": {
    "exclude": [
      "geometry"
    ]
  }
}
```

To return the `id`, `type`, `geometry`, and the Properties attribute `eo:cloud_cover`.  This **must** return a valid STAC Item, as the includes are added to the default includes. Explicitly specifying `id`, `type`, and `geometry` has not effect as these are default fields, but `properties.eo:cloud_cover` is not a default field and thereby should be in the response.

```json
{
  "fields": {
    "include": [
      "id",
      "type",
      "geometry",
      "properties.eo:cloud_cover"
    ]
  }
}
```

To include `id` and all the properties fields, except for the `proj:geometry` field

```json
{
  "fields": {
    "include": [
      "id",
      "properties"
    ],
    "exclude": [    
      "properties.proj:geometry"
    ]
  }
}
```
