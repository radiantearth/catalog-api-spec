## Unreleased

### Added

- A `description` field has been added to Item assets (also Asset definitions extension). 
- Extensions:
     - [Version Indicators extension](extensions/version/README.md), adds `version` and `deprecated` fields to STAC Items and Collections.
     - Instrument extension, adds fields: `platform`, `instruments`, `constellation` (all moved from EO and SAR extensions), and `mission`.

     - Added the [Item and Collection API Version extension](api-spec/extensions/version/README.md) to support versioning in the API specification

### Changed
- Support for [CommonMark 0.29 instead of CommonMark 0.28](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.29/changes.html).
- Collection field `property` and the merge ability moved to a new extension 'Commons'
- Added attribute `role` to Item assets (also Asset definitions extension), to be used similarly to Link `rel`.
- Collection `summaries` merge array fields now.
- Extensions:
    - [datetime-range extension](extensions/datetime-range/README.md): Removed extension prefix from example and schema.
    - Data Cube extension: Changed allowed formats (removed PROJ string, addedPROJJSON / WKT2) for reference systems.
    - [Checksum extension](extensions/checksum/README.md) is now using self-identifiable hashes ([Multihash](https://github.com/multiformats/multihash)).
    - EO extension: Fields `eo:gsd` / `gsd` (in bands) have been renamed to `eo:resolution` / `resolution`.
- STAC API:
    - The endpoint `/stac` has been merged with `/`
    - The endpoint `/stac/search` is now called `/search`
    - Sort Extension - added non-JSON query/form parameter format.
    - Fields extension has a simplified format for GET parameters.

## [v0.5.2] - 2018-07-12

Minor bug fixes on 0.5.1 for the schema files. Thanks @francbartoli


## [v0.5.1] - 2018-07-06

Minor bug fixes from 0.5.1 release

*  [Update openapi / swagger specs for new 'links'](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/commit/480d4fb02b4a7e880c7ca01320fe2773260ba595)
* [minor fixes on collection extension](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/124) - thanks @m-mohr
* [minor cbers example updates](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/123) - thanks @fredliporace


## [v0.5.0] - 2018-07-01

The 0.5.0 release of the STAC spec is an iteration forward on the spec, with a number of core improvements. Highlights include:

* **Links is now a dictionary** - This is the most core change done. It aligns the structure with the 'asset' change in 0.5.0, making it easier for clients to look up the link that they want more easily. The schema is updated to this (and actually checks assets better now, thanks @mojodna )

* **Transactions Extension** - There is now a transaction extension for the STAC API, thanks to @hgs-msmith and @hgs-trutherford

* **Collections iterations** @matthewhanson has evolved the collections extension, adding in some namespace type hints on it, and explaining it more clearly.

* **eo:crs to eo:epsg** In the EO profile @matthewhanson brought in a change to use EPSG code, instead of full Well Known Text, to make it easy to reference.

## [v0.4.1] - 2018-04-24

A few minor improvements on the release. ([issues](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=milestone%3A0.4.1+))

* @hgs-msmith got a swagger version of the spec, and made some minor improvements to the openapi version #103 and #102
* @francbartoli and @m-mohr pointed out some inconsistencies with landsat, so got the openapi updated #106
* @m-mohr pointed out some issues with landsat example, so updated those #105
* @hgs-trutherford pointed out that the planet example was a bit confusing, so updated it to the EO profile.


## [v0.4.0] - 2018-04-06

The 0.4.0 is the first 'official' release of the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification!

It is the result of the [ft. collins sprint](https://github.com/radiantearth/community-sprints/tree/master/03072018-ft-collins-co), the second in person meeting of the STAC community. But it also includes
a number of improvements from remote contributors.

Highlights include:

* Updates to the core **`Item` JSON specification**, including simplifying to a single datetime, moving thumbnails from 'links' to 'assets', making assets a dictionary for easier lookup and requiring `self` links to be absolute links.

* Alignment of **STAC API** with the new [WFS3](https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/) specification

* Cleanup of the **static catalog** specification for greater clarity around the catalog

* A first cut of an **Earth Observation Profile**, as well as a new collections extension to support it.

* Numerous small improvements and bug fixes.

See the [milestone 0.4.0 in the issue tracker](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/milestone/3) for the complete lists of improvements.

Thanks @hgs-msmith, @matthewhanson, @hgs-trutherford, @rouault, @joshfix, @alkamin, @hemphillda, @jeffnaus  and @fredliporace for contributing to the spec directly, and to [everyone](https://github.com/opengeospatial/wfs3hackathon/blob/master/notes/introductions.md#participants) who participated in the [Ft Collins sprint](https://github.com/radiantearth/community-sprints/tree/master/03072018-ft-collins-co) and brought great ideas.
