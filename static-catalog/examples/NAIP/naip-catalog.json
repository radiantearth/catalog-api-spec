Collection was performed using a combination of twin-engine aircraft flying at 17,500 ft above mean terrain with 25% sidelap, giving the collected data nominal ground sampling distance of 0.7 meters. Based-upon the CCD Array configuration present in the ADS40 digital sensor, imagery for each flight line is 12,000-pixels in width.  Red, Green, Blue, Near-Infrared and Panchromatic image bands were collected.  Collected data was downloaded to portable hard drives and shipped to the processing facility daily.  Raw flight data was extracted from external data drives using GPro software. Airborne GPS / IMU data was post-processed using IALS, PosPac and/or TerraPos software and reviewed to ensure sufficient accuracy for project requirements.  Using Pictovera software, planar rectified images were generated from the collected data for use in image quality review.  The planar rectified images were generated at five meter resolution using a two standard deviation histogram stretch.  Factors considered during this review included but were not limited to the presence of smoke and/or cloud cover, contrails, light conditions, sun glint and any sensor or hardware-related issues that potentially could result in faulty data.  When necessary, image strips identified as not meeting image quality specifications were re-flown to obtain suitable imagery.  Aero triangulation blocks were defined primarily by order of acquisition and consisted of four to seventeen strips. Image tie points providing the observations for the least squares bundle adjustment were selected from the images using an auto correlation algorithm. Photogrammetric control points consisted of photo identifiable control points, collected using GPS field survey techniques.  The control points were loaded in to a softcopy workstation and measured in the acquired image strips.  A least squares bundle adjustment of image pass points, control points and the ABGPS was performed to develop an aero triangulation solution for each block using Pictovera software.  Upon final bundle adjustment, the triangulated strips were ortho-rectified to the digital elevation model (DEM) The most recent USGS 10 meter DEMs were used in the rectification process.  Positional accuracy was reviewed in the rectified imagery by visually verifying the horizontal positioning of the known photo-identifiable survey locations using ArcGIS software.  The red, green, and blue bands were combined to generate a final ortho-rectified image strip. The ADS40 sensor collects twelve bit image data which requires radiometric adjustment for output in standard eight bit image channels.  The ortho- rectified image strips were produced with the full 12 bit data range, allowing radiometric adjustment to 8 bit range to be performed on a strip by strip basis during the final mosaicking steps.  The imagery was mosaicked using manual seam line generation in Orthovista Seam Editor (OVSE). The 12 bit data range was adjusted for display in standard eight bit image channels by defining a piecewise histogram stretch using OrthoVista software.  A constant stretch was defined for each image collection period, and then strip by strip adjustments were made as needed to account for changes in sun angle and azimuth during the collection period.  Strip adjustments were also made to match the strips histograms as closely as possible to APFO specified histogram metrics and color balance requirements. Automated balancing algorithms were applied to account for bi- directional reflectance as a final step before the conversion to 8 bit data range DOQQ Production Process Description  USDA FSA APFO NAIP Program 2013  DOQQ Production Process Description  USDA FSA APFO NAIP Program 2013  State  The imagery was collected using ADS40-SH51 digital sensors.

                    "abstract": "This data set contains imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP).  The NAIP program is administered by USDA FSA and has been established to support two main FSA strategic goals centered on agricultural production. These are, increase stewardship of America's natural resources while enhancing the environment, and to ensure commodities are procured and distributed effectively and efficiently to increase food security.  The NAIP program supports these goals by acquiring and providing ortho imagery that has been collected during the agricultural growing season in the U.S. The NAIP ortho imagery is tailored to meet FSA requirements and is a fundamental tool used to support FSA farm and conservation programs.  Ortho imagery provides an effective, intuitive means of communication about farm program administration between FSA and stakeholders.   New technology and innovation is identified by fostering and maintaining a relationship with vendors and government partners, and by keeping pace with the broader geospatial community.

The NAIP program is administered by USDA FSA and has been established to support two main FSA strategic goals centered on agricultural production. These are, increase stewardship of America's natural resources while enhancing the environment, and to ensure commodities are procured and distributed effectively and efficiently to increase food security.  The NAIP program supports these goals by acquiring and providing ortho imagery that has been collected during the agricultural growing season in the U.S. The NAIP ortho imagery is tailored to meet FSA requirements and is a fundamental tool used to support FSA farm and conservation programs.  Ortho imagery provides an effective, intuitive means of communication about farm program administration between FSA and stakeholders.   New technology and innovation is identified by fostering and maintaining a relationship with vendors and government partners, and by keeping pace with the broader geospatial community.  As a result of these efforts the NAIP program provides three main products Compressed County Mosaics (CCM), and Seamline shape files The Contract specifications for NAIP imagery have changed over time reflecting agency requirements and improving technologies.  These changes include image resolution, horizontal accuracy, coverage area, and number of bands. In general, flying seasons are established by FSA and are targeted for peak crop growing conditions.  The NAIP acquisition cycle is based on a minimum 3 year refresh of base ortho imagery.  The tiling format of the NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 pixel buffer on all four sides.  NAIP quarter quads are formatted to the UTM coordinate system using the North American Datum of 1983. NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile.",
                    "purpose": "NAIP imagery is available for distribution within 60 days of the end of a flying season and is intended to provide current information of agricultural conditions in support of USDA farm programs. For USDA Farm Service Agency, the 1 meter and 1/2 meter GSD product provides an ortho image base for Common Land Unit boundaries and other data sets.  The 1 meter and 1/2 meter NAIP imagery is generally acquired in projects covering full states in cooperation with state government and other federal agencies that use the imagery for a variety of purposes including land use planning and natural resource assessment.  The NAIP is also used  for disaster response.  While suitable for a variety of uses, prior to 2007 the 2 meter GSD NAIP imagery was primarily intended to assess \"crop condition and compliance\" to USDA farm program conditions. The 2 meter imagery was generally acquired only for agricultural areas within state projects."
