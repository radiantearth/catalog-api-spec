## WARNING

**This is still a work in progress. It is not expected to validate, and still needs more work to flesh out the concepts**

* TODO: Update all Items to stac-item.json validation. 
* TODO: Flesh out all the relationships / links between items.
* TODO: finish up the 'product' type information examples.

These set of examples are meant to show an alternate catalog structuring for a DG static catalog that uses more
links than Jeff Naus's proposal in https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/33
