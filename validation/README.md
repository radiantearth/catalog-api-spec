# STAC Schema Validation

Any JSON Schema validation tool can be used, just run the JSON data to test against the various STAC schema, and be sure to include any remote schema like the geojson.json schema in the testing. 

This directory includes installation instructions for a JavaScript validator, the following shows how to use it.

## Initialization

In this directory run:

```bash
npm install
```

This installs node.js validation modules, in a node_modules directory created in this directory.

## Validation

In the following chapter there are commands to run a validation of any STAC against the JSON Schema.

**Warning:** Not all validation is fully complete. For items, the validator does not yet check for `self` 
links. The `href` checking is probably too loose right now, it just checks for a string, see the 
'relative vs absolute links' section  in the [Item spec](../item-spec/item-spec.md) for reasons why. 

### Catalogs

To run the validation for a catalog file:

```bash
npm run validate_catalog -- -d ../catalog-spec/examples/catalog.json
```

### Datasets

To run the validation for a dataset file:

```bash
npm run validate_dataset -- -d ../dataset-spec/examples/sentinel2.json
```

### Extensions

To run the validation for an extension:

```bash
npm run validate_extension -- -s ../extensions/scientific/schema.json -d ../extensions/scientific/example-merraclim.json
```

This example runs the validation for the scientific extension, please change the `-s` (schema file) and `-d` (data file) accordingly.

### Items

To run the validation for an item file:

```bash
npm run validate_item -- -d ../item-spec/examples/sample.json
```
