# This file tells GitHub who should "own" different extensions.
# Ownership for us means:
# - owners are (automatically) requested for review on any PR touching code in
#   the extensions that they own
# - owners are shown in the UI in GitHub when someone is browsing files
#
# For more information about this file format see an example in the GitHub
# documentation:
