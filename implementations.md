# Implementations

This document lists the various implementations of the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog specification. Contributions 
to the spec should be based on experience building API's for imagery and other geo-asset catalogs, so suggested
changes / improvements to the spec should be based on some software listed here. All listed implementations should have a link to a live server or static catalog that indexes real data, though they do not have to be production ready or have any guarantee of uptime. If a live server is not possible then a link to open source code is also acceptable. 

Browsable online version are usually powered by [stac-browser](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-browser/) unless otherwise stated.

## Static Catalog Examples

### Spacenet (STAC 0.5)

[Spacenet](https://spacenetchallenge.github.io/) has made all their imagery available as STAC.

- Catalog: https://s3.amazonaws.com/spacenet-stac/spacenet-dataset.json
- Browsable online version: https://vigilant-heyrovsky-0d9af8.netlify.com/
- Source code: https://github.com/SpaceNetChallenge/stac-implementation

### CBERS (STAC 0.5)

[CBERS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%E2%80%93Brazil_Earth_Resources_Satellite_program) is maintaining 
a full STAC Catalog, and keeping it up to date with the spec.

- Catalog: https://cbers-stac.s3.amazonaws.com/catalog.json
- Browsable online version: http://cbers-stac.netlify.com/
- Source code: https://github.com/fredliporace/cbers-2-stac

### ISERV (STAC 0.4.1)

[ISERV](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/867.html) data is hosted by
[Radiant.Earth](http://radiant.earth), created by [Azavea](http://azavea.com).

- Catalog: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/radiant-nasa-iserv/iserv.json
- Browsable online version: http://iserv-stac.netlify.com/
- Source code: https://github.com/raster-foundry/pystac

### Planet Disaster Data (STAC 0.5)

[Planet](http://planet.com) maintains a very small, hand-built catalog to serve as a reference example
of the spec.

- Catalog: https://storage.googleapis.com/pdd-stac/disasters/catalog.json
- Browsable online version: http://planet-stac.netlify.com/
- Raw catalog files: https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/pdd-stac/disasters/hurricane-harvey/0831/
- Source code: https://github.com/cholmes/pdd-stac/tree/master/disasters/hurricane-harvey

### DigitalGlobe (STAC 0.4.1)

[DigitalGlobe](http://digitalglobe.com) has a few examples of how they represent their data as STAC Items.

- Examples: https://github.com/TDG-Platform/dg-stac/tree/master/examples

## API (Active Catalog) Examples
### Boundless STAC Server

* Items call: http://stac.boundlessgeo.io/stac/search/stac
* OpenAPI Document: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/joshfix/STAC/1.0.0-RC34

### Harris STAC Server

Contains a number of Landsat records:

* Items call: http://35.160.175.42:8081/items/?limit=10 
* Can see a particular Landsat item at: http://35.160.175.42:8081/items/LC08_L1TP_040032_20170415_20170501_01_T1

### Other implementations

* [Geocatalogo](https://github.com/go-spatial/geocatalogo) is a Go implementation of STAC.

## Ecosystem

Other software related to STAC like validators, crawlers etc.

 * [Serverless STAC Crawler](https://github.com/fredliporace/stac-crawler) is a static STAC crawler that runs on Lambda and SQS integration.
 * [STAC Browser](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-browser/) generates/renders browsable HTML versions of STAC catalogs.

## Early prototypes / outdated

A list of software developed as early prototypes for the proof of concept or seem to be outdated (no activity in more than six months).

* [Catalog Crawler](https://github.com/radiantearth/community-sprints/tree/master/10252017-boulder-co/catalog-crawler) was done during the [Boulder Sprint](https://github.com/radiantearth/community-sprints/tree/master/10252017-boulder-co), as an early proof of concept.
* [py-stac](https://github.com/raster-foundry/pystac) was used to create the ISERV catalog. It is still pretty tied to that data type.
* [go-stac](https://github.com/planetlabs/go-stac) does validation of static catalogs.
* [Open Imagery Network](https://openimagerynetwork.github.io/) was the first attempt at a static catalog. The OpenAerialMap 
  bucket is in active use. It is planned to evolve OIN and OAM architectures to use static catalogs.
* [AWS Public Datasets](http://aws.amazon.com/public-datasets/), particularly [Landsat](http://aws.amazon.com/public-datasets/landsat/), 
  [NAIP](https://aws.amazon.com/public-datasets/naip/) and [Sentinel](http://sentinel-pds.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/) all
  get close to the ideas of STAC static catalogs, and hopefully will evolve to implement the standard.
* Josh Fix's [open-catalog](https://github.com/joshfix/open-catalog) demonstrates generating code from the core swagger spec.
* Element84 made a [clojure implementation](https://github.com/Element84/catalog-api-spec/tree/dev/implementations/e84) of the spec that serves as a lightweight proxy to NASA's CMR, constrained to just data in USGS EROS.
