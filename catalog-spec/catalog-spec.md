# STAC Catalog Specification

This document explains the structure and content of a STAC Catalog. A STAC Catalog is a 
collection of [STAC Items](../item-spec/). These Items can be linked to directly from a Catalog,
or the Catalog can link to other Catalogs (often called sub-Catalogs) that contain links to Items.
The division of sub-catalogs is up to the implementor, but is generally done to aid the ease of 
online browsing by people.

Catalogs are not intended to be queried. Their purpose is discovery: to be browsed by people and crawled
by machines to build a search index. A Catalog can be represented in JSON format. Any JSON object 
that contains all the required fields is a valid STAC Catalog.

- [Examples](examples/)
- [JSON Schema](json-schema/catalog.json)

This Catalog specification primarily defines a structure for information to be discoverable. Any use 
that is publishing a set of related spatiotemporal assets is strongly recommended to also use the 
[STAC Collection specification](../collection-spec/) to provide additional information about a set of Items 
contained in a catalog, to give contextual information to aid in discovery. Every STAC Collection is 
also a valid STAC Catalog.

## WARNING

**This is still an early version of the STAC spec, expect that there may be some changes before
everything is finalized.**

Implementations are encouraged, however, as good effort will be made to not change anything too
drastically. Using the specification now will ensure that needed changes can be made before
everything is locked in. So now is an ideal time to implement, as your feedback will be directly
incorporated.

## Catalog Definitions

There are two required element types of a Catalog: Catalog and Item. A STAC Catalog
points to [STAC Items](../item-spec/README.md), or to other STAC catalogs. It provides a simple
linking structure that can be used recursively so that many Items can be included in 
a single Catalog, organized however the implementor desires. 

STAC makes no formal distinction between a "root" catalog and the "child" catalogs. A root catalog
is simply a top-most catalog (which has no parent). A nested catalog structure is useful (and
recommended) for breaking up massive numbers of catalog items into logical groupings. For example,
it might make sense to organize a catalog by date (year, month, day), or geography (continent,
country, state/prov). Any scheme may be used, but it's considered a best practice to keep the size
of each catalog under a megabyte.

A simple Catalog structure might look like this:

- catalog (root)
  - catalog
    - catalog
      - item
        - asset
      - item
        - asset
    - item
      - asset
      - asset

This example might be considered a somewhat "typical" structure. However, catalogs and items can
describe a number of different relationships. The following shows various relationships between
catalogs and items:

- `Catalog` -> `Item` (this is a common structure for a catalog to list links to items)
- `Catalog` -> `Catalog` (this is a common tree structure to group sets of items. Each catalog in
  this relationship may also include item links as well as catalog links)

As all STAC Collections are also valid STAC Catalogs, all Catalogs described here could also be Collections.

The relationships are all described by a common `links` object structure, making use of
the `rel` attribute to further describe the relationship. 

There are a few types of catalogs that implementors occasionally refer to. These get defined by the `links` structure.

- A **sub-catalog** is a Catalog that is linked to from another Catalog that is used to better organize data. For example a Landsat collection
  might have sub-catalogs for each Path and Row, so as to create a nice tree structure for users to follow.
- A **root catalog** is a Catalog that only links to sub-catalogs. These are typically entry points for browsing data. Often
  they will contain the [STAC Collection](../collection-spec) definition, but in implementations that publish diverse information it may
  contain sub-catalogs that provide a variety of collections.
- A **parent catalog** is the Catalog that sits directly above a sub-catalog. Following parent catalog links continuously
  will naturally end up at a root catalog definition.
 
It should be noted that a Catalog does not have to link back to all the other Catalogs that point to it. Thus a published 
root catalog might be a sub-catalog of someone else's structure. The goal is for data providers to publish all the 
information and links they want to, while also encouraging a natural web of information to arise as Catalogs and Items are
linked to across the web.

There are a number of emerging 'best practices' for how to organize and implement good catalogs. These can be found in
the [best practices document](../best-practices.md), and include things like catalog layout, use of self links, 
publishing catalogs, and more. This specification is designed for maximum flexbility, but the best practices provide
guidance for good recommendations when implementing.

## Catalog fields

| Element         | Type          | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| stac_version    | string        | **REQUIRED.** The STAC version the catalog implements. STAC versions can be mixed, but please keep the [recommended best practices](../best-practices.md#mixing-stac-versions) in mind. |
| stac_extensions | \[string]     | A list of extension identifiers the Catalog implements.                 |
| id              | string        | **REQUIRED.** Identifier for the catalog.                    |
| title           | string        | A short descriptive one-line title for the catalog.          |
| description     | string        | **REQUIRED.** Detailed multi-line description to fully explain the catalog. [CommonMark 0.29](http://commonmark.org/) syntax MAY be used for rich text representation. |
| links           | [[Link Object](#link-object)] | **REQUIRED.** A list of references to other documents.       |

**stac_extensions**: A list of extensions the Catalog implements. This does NOT declare the extensions of children or Items. The list contains URLs to the JSON Schema files it can be validated against. For official [content extensions](../extensions/README.md#list-of-content-extensions), a "shortcut" can be used. This means you can specify the folder name of the extension, for example `pointcloud` for the Point Cloud extension. This does *not* apply for API extensions. If the versions of the extension and the catalog diverge, you can specify the URL of the JSON schema file.
This list must only contain extensions that extend the Catalog itself, see the the 'Scope' column in the list of extensions.

### Link Object

This object describes a relationship with another entity. Data providers are advised to be liberal
with links.

| Field Name | Type   | Description                                                                                                                         |
| ---------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| href       | string | **REQUIRED.** The actual link in the format of an URL. Relative and absolute links are both allowed.                                |
| rel        | string | **REQUIRED.** Relationship between the current document and the linked document. See chapter ["Relation types"](#relation-types) for more information. |
| type       | string | [Media type](../item-spec/item-spec.md#media-types) of the referenced entity.                                                       |
| title      | string | A human readable title to be used in rendered displays of the link.                                                                 |

A more complete list of possible 'rel' types can be seen at the [IANA page of Link Relation Types](https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml).

Please see the chapter 'relative vs absolute links' in the [Item spec](../item-spec/item-spec.md#relative-vs-absolute-links)
for a discussion on that topic, as well as the [use of links](../best-practices.md#use-of-links) section of the 
catalog best practices document.

#### Relation types

The following types are commonly used as `rel` types in the Link Object of a STAC Catalog:

| Type    | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| self    | STRONGLY RECOMMENDED. *Absolute* URL to the location that the catalog file can be found online, if available. This is particularly useful when in a download package that includes metadata, so that the downstream user can know where the data has come from. |
| root    | STRONGLY RECOMMENDED. URL to the root STAC Catalog or [Collection](../collection-spec/README.md). Catalogs should include a link to their root, even if it's the root and points to itself. |
| parent  | URL to the parent STAC Catalog or [Collection](../collection-spec/README.md). Non-root catalogs should include a link to their parent. |
| child   | URL to a child STAC Catalog or [Collection](../collection-spec/README.md). |
| item    | URL to a STAC [Item](../item-spec/item-spec.md). |

**Note:** A link to at least one `item` or `child` catalog is **REQUIRED**.

## Examples

A catalog of
[NAIP imagery](https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/aerial-photography/imagery-programs/naip-imagery/)
might look something like this:

```json
{
  "stac_version": "0.9.0",
  "id": "NAIP",
  "description": "Catalog of NAIP Imagery",
  "links": [
    { "rel": "self", "href": "https://www.fsa.usda.gov/naip/catalog.json" },
    { "rel": "child", "href": "https://www.fsa.usda.gov/naip/30087/catalog.json" },
    { "rel": "root", "href": "https://www.fsa.usda.gov/catalog.json" }
  ]
}
```

In addition, the catalog shown above is strongly recommended to also follow the [STAC Collection specification](../collection-spec/collection-spec.md) 
to add more information about the NAIP imagery such as the spatial and temporal extents, a license and more.

A typical *child* sub-catalog could look similar:

```json
{
  "stac_version": "0.9.0",
  "id": "NAIP",
  "description": "Catalog of NAIP Imagery - 30087",
  "links": [
    { "rel": "self", "href": "https://www.fsa.usda.gov/naip/30087/catalog.json" },
    { "rel": "parent", "href": "../catalog.json" },
    { "rel": "root", "href": "https://www.fsa.usda.gov/catalog.json" },
    { "rel": "item", "href": "https://www.fsa.usda.gov/naip/30087/m_3008718_sw_16_1_20130805.json" },
    { "rel": "item", "href": "https://www.fsa.usda.gov/naip/30087/m_3008718_sw_16_1_20130806.json" }
  ]
}
```

The `root` catalog in this example could hold a set of sub-catalogs with different STAC collections, e.g. data from other satellites or processed variants of the NAIP imagery.

## Extensions

The [extensions page](../extensions/) gives an overview about relevant extensions for STAC Catalogs.
