# STAC Catalogs

While an [Item](../item-spec/item-spec.md) is the atomic unit of a SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog, the Catalog JSON definition is the core structure that enables browsers and crawlers to access
the sets of Items. A Catalog consists of links to other Catalogs and Items, and can include
additional metadata to further describe its holdings. It is defined in full in the 
[Catalog Specification](catalog-spec.md).

While Catalogs mostly describe a structure of links and Items, a key related specification is the [Datasets](../dataset-spec/) 
spec,Â which extend Catalogs with additional fields to further describe the set of Items in a Catalog. Datasets share the same 
fields with Catalogs and therefore every Dataset is also a valid Catalog.

Catalogs are designed so that a simple file server on the web or object store like Amazon S3 can store JSON that defines a 
full Catalog. More dynamic services can also return a Catalog structure, and the [STAC API](../api-spec/) folder contains 
an OpenAPI definition of the standard way to do this, at the `/stac/` endpoint. 

## In this directory

**The Specification:** The main Catalog specification is in
*[catalog-spec.md](catalog-spec.md)*. It includes an overview and in depth explanation of the 
structures and fields.

**Examples:** For samples of how Catalogs can be implemented the *[examples/](examples/)* folder
contains a full sample catalog. 

**Schemas:** The schemas to validate the core `Catalog` definition are found in the *[json-schema/](json-schema/)* folder. The primary one is *[catalog.json](json-schema/catalog.json)*.

## In the API directory

**Dynamic Catalog OpenAPI Definition:** The [stac-api](../api-spec) directory contains OpenAPI definitions of the `/stac/`
endpoint, that is the dynamic version of a Catalog. See [STAC-standalone.yaml](../api-spec/STAC-standalone.yaml), or you can
browse it online on [swaggerhub's STAC-standalone](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/cholmesgeo/STAC-standalone/0.6.0-beta#/STAC/get_stac) definition.

## Schema Validation

Instruction on schema validation for STAC Catalog can be found in the [validation instructions](validation/README.md).


## Catalog Evolution 

The Catalog specification is maturing, but it is still relatively early days. The core of Catalog has been defined very
narrowly, to just describe a structure that can be followed by people or machines, so most additional functionality will
be defined in additional specifications and extensions. The only anticipated changes to the core of Catalog are to add in
additional extension mechanisms for others to use.


#### Recommendations

The evolution of static catalogs is driven by real implementations in the world. Many are adding in additional innovations
that are not yet part of the specification, but other implementors are encouraged to make use of. The various recommendations 
can be viewed in the [Catalog Recommendations](catalog-recommendations.md) document. Some of these will likely
evolve to be requirements, or at least documented specification options and extensions.
